            <h3 class="title"><i class="fas fa-flask"></i> COMMUNITY </h3>  
            <p>
              I can't stress enough how important the concept of a community has been to me lately. I like to participate in healthy communities,
              sometimes that means brining them together where I see a gap. I've tought a lot of classes through meetup on various topics just to share knowledge
              and get the perspective of others. The 3d printing community when it was RepRap (before makerbot existed) is one of the driving forces that motivated me to push through the obstacles.
              The knowledge that what I discovered would help others in their experience and we would all move forward together. I have found a similar community in Blender. 
              I run some of the Discord servers and participate in those communities. I also created a couple new ones where I saw a gap such as Blender addon developers working toegther.
              I was able to take this experience and apply it to a security community recently and I'm so thrilled it was immediately successful. I've worked with people who knew that communities were important
               but didnt have enough earnest interest in developing them. They felt cold and transactional. My recent experiences affirm my notion that great communities are where great thigns happen.

            <p>
              Creative thinking is fun. It takes measurement, iteration and perseverance to make progress and know it. I highly recommend the Book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Box-Thinking-People-Mistakes-But/dp/1591848229"><span style="color:#fff">Black Box Thinking</span></a> to anyone willing to put in the work to make serious improvements in what they do. <p>Engineering is a mindset that can be applied to any task.</p>

              <blockquote>A good scientist is a person with original ideas. A good engineer is a person who makes a design that works with as few ideas as possible. There are no prima donnas in engineering. <br/> ― Freeman Dyson (different Dyson)</blockquote> <br/>

            <h4>DATA VISUALIZATION</h4>
            <p>
              There is a different level of understanding when data is visualized intelligently. We are wired to process visual information much more naturally than grids of text. I've been part of a growing movement to pay more attention to the presentation of data easier to consume ways breaking past the restrictions of static images on paper and seeing what we can do. If you pass this off as being eye candy, or just making data pretty. I'd be happy to change your perspective.

            <h4>SECURITY</h4>
            <p>
              Wouldn't technology be great if it wasn't abused? Ohwell, that's why we have to think of security. I am always balancing the security effort and spend with the business needs, risk and complexity. Businesses and people need to be secured so that they can get on with the things they intended to accomplish. Not replace those things with being secure and not having any activity or money left to secure. I have been in the security industry long enough to break past buzzwords and fear marketing to practical actions.

            <h4>DEVELOPMENT</h4>
            <p>
              Software development is a great tool. It helps me accomplish the things I need to for myself and businesses. I don't apply this tool for any instrinsic value but as a means to get things accomplished. I'll leave others to their discussion on perfecting the art and what language is best while I move to the next project that needs to be accomplished. I run development teams with a similar philosophy. If it meets the requirements it's correct. If there's no measurable difference that provides value it's developers choice.

              Ideas are cheap. I'm not that proud of them. Most great ideas already exist, but someone didnt take the time to develop them. I commit to an idea, develop it, test it and share the results. This is the majority of the work and where all the credit should come from.

            <h4>INTERACTIVE CONFERENCE BADGE</h4>
            <p>
              I developed an electronic conference badge that can be used to interact between vendors, coordinators and participants. It's designed with lights, motors, a screen and wireless connectivity capabilities. Different 3D printed bodies can be created for it to fit the theme of an event and be swapped out for other events.

            <p>
              I have been building 3D printers with the <a href="http://reprap.org"> RepRap foundation</a> since before you could buy one for home use. It was a lot of fun to work with a community to build a machine for about $1k that you had to spend $30k to buy commercially. Now that home 3d printers are an everyday commodity I have been working with the <a href="https://www.maslowcnc.com/">MaslowCNC</a> project to bring the same advancement to full size (4'x8') CNC routing. There's an additional level of enthusiasm when creating things that help you make better things.

            <p>
              I'm constantly learning. For things I have been learning for a while and accumulated some expertise I offer to help others. Whether it's kids getting excited about technology or getting adults to branch out, I enjoy participating in tech communities. I'm regularly participating and presenting in conferences, meetups and faires. My topics include: Security, Data Visualization, Making things, Software development and general career topics.

                    <p>
                      Make conferences and events more social and interactive with Jasperboard badges. <br/>
                      You can customize most aspects of the badge to fit your event in a fraction of the time it would take to create a new one. <br/>
                      Get your attendees to engage with each other and vendors by gamifying interactions. <br/>
                      Give them a unique event experience <br/>
                      Set your event apart as one vendors want to participate in due to the higher engagement. <br/>
